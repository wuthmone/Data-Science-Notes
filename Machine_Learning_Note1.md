* Learn and Generalise

###Four Learning Types  
1. Supervised learning  
2. Unsupervised learning  
3. Reinforcement learning 
4. Evolutionary learning 


###Supervised learning  
A training set of examples with the correct responses (targets) is
provided and, based on this training set, the algorithm generalises to respond correctly
to all possible inputs. This is also called learning from exemplars.

###Unsupervised learning  
Correct responses are not provided, but instead the algorithm
tries to identify similarities between the inputs so that inputs that have something in
common are categorised together. The statistical approach to unsupervised learning is
known as density estimation.

###Reinforcement learning  
This is somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learn-
ing. The algorithm gets told when the answer is wrong, but does not get told how to
correct it. It has to explore and try out different possibilities until it works out how to
get the answer right. Reinforcement learning is sometime called learning with a critic
because of this monitor that scores the answer, but does not suggest improvements.

###Evolutionary learning  
Biological evolution can be seen as a learning process: biological
organisms adapt to improve their survival rates and chance of having offspring in their
environment. Weâ€™ll look at how we can model this in a computer, using an idea of
fitness, which corresponds to a score for how good the current solution is.


#Supervised Learning

## Regression and Classification  
* Regression : predict continuous valued output  
* Classificaiton: predict discrete valued output  

#Machine Learning Process  

* Data Collection and Preparation : getting clean data and 
* Feature Selection : Useful features for examining purpose
* Algorithm Choice : best suitable algorithm for the given problem
* Parameter and Model Selection : select pareameter for algorithm
* Training : training using computatinal resources
* Evaluation : test for accuracy
